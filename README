Against Dragons is a simple toolkit for researchers and other folk who want to
work with geospatial survey data. It provides a researcher dashboard for working
with and exporting survey data, and an API for capturing and working with
GPS data: currently limited to the kind of data you can read from smartphone
GPS/Mapping systems.

It's made with Python and Javascript over the GeoDjango framework, and thus
supports all of the geospatial database systems supported by that fine
framework. At the moment, the examples are configured to work with Postgres 9,
PostGIS 2.0, Proj 4, and GDal.
